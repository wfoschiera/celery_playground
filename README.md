# Celery Playground

In this exciting playground project, we will delve into the world of asynchronous task management using
Celery Canvas, a powerful task orchestration tool. Our primary objective is to create a hands-on learning
experience for Celery enthusiasts, as we leverage Celery in combination with RabbitMQ and Redis to build
a robust and efficient task management system for a virtual playground environment.

## Project Goals:

Understanding Celery: Gain a deep understanding of the Celery distributed task queue framework, including its
components and workflow.

- Explore Celery Canvas: Delve into Celery Canvas, an extension of Celery that allows for the chaining and
grouping of tasks to create complex workflows.

- Setup and Configuration: Set up and configure Celery, RabbitMQ, and Redis to work harmoniously within the
project environment.

- Task Definition: Define a range of tasks that mimic real-world scenarios in a playground, such as slide
time tracking, swing coordination, and sandbox maintenance.

- Task Chaining: Implement task chaining to demonstrate how one task can trigger another, creating a sequential
flow of operations.

- Task Grouping: Explore task grouping to parallelize independent tasks within the playground system.

- Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures within the task execution
process.

- Monitor and Visualization: Incorporate monitoring and visualization tools to gain insights into task
execution and system performance.

- Scalability: Discuss and implement strategies to scale the playground system horizontally to accommodate
increasing task loads.

- Documentation: Maintain comprehensive project documentation, including setup instructions, code explanations,
and usage examples.

## Technologies and Tools:

- Celery: As our primary task queue and worker system.
- RabbitMQ: As the message broker for distributing tasks.
- Redis: As the backend storage and message broker for Celery.
- Python: The programming language used for developing the project.
- Django (optional): If desired, integrate Celery Canvas into a Django web application for a more tangible use case.

## Expected Deliverables:

[ ] A well-documented project repository containing the source code.
[ ] Detailed documentation on setting up and running the project.
[ ] Examples showcasing task chaining and grouping using Celery Canvas.
[ ] Visualizations and logs demonstrating task execution and performance metrics.
[ ] An optional presentation or tutorial for sharing the project's insights with others.

This playground project will not only provide you with hands-on experience in working with Celery Canvas but
also give you a solid foundation for building complex, distributed systems that can handle a variety of tasks
asynchronously. It's an excellent opportunity to explore the capabilities of these technologies in a fun and
practical context while gaining valuable skills in asynchronous task management.
